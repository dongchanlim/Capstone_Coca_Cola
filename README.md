## Introduction
In terms of food & beverage industry, the production efficiency is key to keep competitive position in the market. 

For Swire Coca-Cola, one of the world’s largest beaverage corportate, machine downtime isn’t just a technical challenge, which causes a $60 million annual loss. To tackle this problem, our capstone project focused on improving the company’s maintenance operations with predictive analytics.

By analyzing machine performance data, we identified the breakdown patterns to predict equipment failure occurences and optimize maintenance schedules based on the patterns. This proactive approach minimizes unplanned breakdowns, streamlines the smooth production, lowers the wastesd costs, and improves overall efficiency. Our work highlights how data-driven approaches can turn log data into actionable results, creating a stronger, more reliable manufacturing process.

## Business Problem
Swire Coca-Cola’s six manufacturing plants produce a staggering 192 million beverages annually. 

However, unplanned machine breakdowns have brought production capacity down to 94.4%, causing substantial delays and financial losses. These unpredictable failures result in frequent downtime, missed production targets, and increased costs, amounting to an estimated $60 million in annual losses. 

Therefore, it is essential to maintain production goals and profitability by addressing the issue and find out resolution.

## Proposed Solution
Our solution focuses on survival analysis applied to unplanned downtime data, enabling the prediction of time-to-failure before critical equipment failure occurs. 

Using predictive models, we can allocate maintenance schedules tailored to minimize unplanned operational disruptions. 

This approach empowers Swire Coca-Cola to anticipate failures, reduce operational downtime, and optimize maintenance resources, thereby improving production capacity and reducing costs.

## Model Performance Highlights
Among the multiple variations of regression model, The ElasticNet regression model demonstrated superior predictive performance, achieving:

- Test RMSE: 82.27
- Test MSE: 6767.92

This model effectively balances bias and variance, making it a reliable choice for predicting maintenance outcomes and optimizing operations.

## Key Insights from Survival Analysis

- Conducted Kaplan-Meier survival estimates to predict the duration of equipment time-to-failure.
- Filtered and concentrated on unplanned downtime data to identify trends and probabilities of machine breakdowns.
- LogRank tests were conducted as a part of robustness checks to validate the survival analysis results

Our survival analysis revealed the following average failure times for equipment at key plant locations:

- Roma (G812): Equipment fails, on average, within 0.47 days.
- Cota (G816): Average failure time is 0.65 days.
- Suzuka (G221): Equipment tends to fail after 1.24 days.

These insights provide actionable recommendations for proactive maintenance, helping reduce unplanned downtime across locations.

## My contribution to the project

As a team member of this project, I mainly contributed to the project with:

- Implemented the data preprocessing and cleansing data for predictive modeling 
- Built the regression models to predict when is the next breakdown point based on the historical data
- Structured and organized the teamwork virtual environment using online tools such as Google docs, Trello, and Teams
- Designed the team presentation and  the compelling pitching notes.

## Difficulties that encountered along the way

Since the variable metadata & description of given dataset ('IWC_Work_Orders_Extract.csv') was not very familiar with me, it was taking time to comprehend how the data itself reflects the real-case in the manufactoring process. Also, defining what is the business problem and tranforming the data insight into business impact was tough process to navigate.

## What I learned in the project

There are 2 lessons that I've learned from the project and ensured to apply for:

- Delivering measurable and actionable takeaways, ensuring our insights drive real business value for stakeholders.
- Adopting a business-first approach, focusing on the practical solutions rather than solely relying on statistical output.

This project was not just about analytics but also about framework, collaboration, and real problem-solving.
Starting from scratch, we built our project step by step—learning, iterating, and collaborating each other throughout the process.

## Conclusion and Summary

Our project highlights the critical role of data-driven maintenance strategies in addressing operational inefficiencies at Swire Coca-Cola. By leveraging survival analysis and regression models, we developed tools to forecast equipment failures and proactively reduce unplanned downtime, leading to improved production efficiency.
